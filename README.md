# Encryptor/Decryptor
Using object-oriented programming in Python, I built a program that decrypts an encrypted text when given the cipher and encrypts a text according to the desired cipher. 

Ps4a is a helper recursive function for the program, ps4b is a normal Encryptor/Decryptor that encrypts/decrypts all letters, and ps4c only decrypts/encrypts vowels.
